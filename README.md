**This is part of a project series to demonstrate my capability and effectiveness to use several tools to conduct industry standard automation testing to both mobile and web applications while improving the overall QA process.**

### Prerequisites

- Have an IDE installed on your computer to be able to view the code locally.
- Have a good working knowledge of Git and Github and well as JavaScript.
- Have a Chrome or Firefox browser installed on your computer.

### Setup

- Open a command line terminal (Git bash preferrably) and navigate to a directory where you would like to save the work folder using cd.
- Clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/wale-prog/orangeHRM_automation.git
- To get the curent working tree, git fetch --all, then checkout to "dev" branch.
- Finally, run the test scripts within the `login.cy.js` file by doing the following:
  - navigate to the root directory with a command line terminal.
  - run `npm install`, this install all the project dependencies.
  - if you have chrome installed run `npm run cy-chrome` or `npm run cy-firefox` if you have firefox installed to start the test.
